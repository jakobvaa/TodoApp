# TodoApp
Simple console based todoapp in C#. 
My first project in C#, still much to learn

To run the app navigate into the project directory and run the command "dotnet run".

The tests for the project was not completed as I had trouble using the namespace using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;
on Linux. Was using Visual Studio Code.
