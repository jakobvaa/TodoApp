# TodoApp
Simple console based todoapp in C#. 
My first project using the language, still much to learn

To run the app navigate into the project directory and run
```
dotnet run
```

The tests for the project was not completed as I had trouble using the namespace 
Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting
on Linux. Was using Visual Studio Code.
